# TODO

This is a sample application that runs with [bang.sh](https://github.com/bellthoven/bangsh).
To run this application, you need the framework too.

```
cd ~/Projects
git clone https://github.com/bellthoven/bangsh
git clone https://github.com/bellthoven/todo-sample
cd todo-sample
```

Now you can play with it:

```bash
# Add todo items
./todo add "My todo item"
# List them
./todo list
# Remove an item
./todo del 1
```
